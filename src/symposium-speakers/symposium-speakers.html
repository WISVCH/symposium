      <symposium-speaker name="Phil Zimmermann" title="Practical strategies for secure voice and text messages" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/phil_zimmermann.jpg">
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Philip R. Zimmermann is the creator of Pretty Good Privacy, an email encryption software package. Originally designed as a human rights tool, PGP was published for free on the Internet in 1991. This made Zimmermann the target of a three-year criminal investigation, because the government held that US export restrictions for cryptographic software were violated when PGP spread worldwide. Despite the lack of funding, the lack of any paid staff, the lack of a company to stand behind it, and despite government persecution, PGP nonetheless became the most widely used email encryption software in the world. After the government dropped its case in early 1996, Zimmermann founded PGP Inc. That company was acquired by Network Associates Inc (NAI) in 1997. In 2002 PGP was acquired from NAI by a new company called PGP Corporation, where Zimmermann served as special advisor and consultant until its acquisition by Symantec in 2010. Since 2004, his focus has been on secure telephony for the Internet, developing the ZRTP protocol and creating products that use it, including Silent Phone and Zfone. Zimmermann is Co-founder of Silent Circle, a provider of secure communications services, and is a partner at Mjolnir Ventures, a European venture fund specializing in cyber security. Zimmermann teaches crypto at Delft University of Technology's Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, in the Netherlands.

      <symposium-speaker name="Herbert Bos" title="New generation of security problems" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/herbert_bos.png">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Just a few years ago, I would start the first lecture in my course on security by telling the students that the security problems are caused by bad software. Most software is full of security holes. Indeed, much research is directed at removing these bugs. But is this sufficient? In this talk, I will discuss a new wave of vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit "perfect" (bugless) software by making use of bizarre effects in common hardware.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Herbert Bos is professor of Systems and Network Security at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where he heads the VUSec research group. He obtained his Ph.D. from Cambridge University Computer Laboratory (UK). Coming from a systems background, he drifted into security a few years ago and never left. CSrankings.org listed the group as the #1 research group in Computer Security in the world over 2016. He is very proud of his (former) students, three of whom have won the Roger Needham Ph.D. Award for best Ph.D. thesis in systems in Europe.

      <symposium-speaker name="Wieb Bosma" title="Cryptography and prime numbers" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/wieb_bosma.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Many important protocols for cryptography that are based on mathematics are dependent on properties of prime numbers. In particular, they often rely for their security on the difficulty of certain problems, such as determining discrete logarithms in certain groups, or finding the order of (elements in) those groups, defined in terms of `large' prime numbers; in many cases prime factorisation is a bottleneck in the computations. The aim of this talk is to provide a feeling for what `large prime numbers' are: how hard is it to find them and to distinguish them from composite numbers? What properties of primes are essential and which algorithms are used? At what size of parameters is it still possible to deal with the cryptographic challenges using a publicly available, but highly developed, computer algebra system?
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Wieb Bosma (Texel, 1958) studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where he also wrote his Ph.D. thesis (on an algorithm for primality proving). After that, he worked for seven years at the University of Sydney, Australia, on the development of the language for the computer algebra system Magma, while also responsible for the number theoretic and combinatorial algorithms implemented in that system. Currently, he is associate professor in Computer Algebra at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where he teaches Mathematics and conducts research on algorithms and automata, on the border of Mathematics and Computer Science. He is also associated with the Cryptology group of Ronald Cramer at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam.

      <symposium-speaker name="Bart Seghers (Thales)" title="Cybercrime and trends" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/bart_seghers.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Cyber threats and cyber-attacks pop up in the media every day. Furthermore, they seem to be getting more and more sophisticated over time. Who are performing these attacks nowadays? And are we lost already because of their complexity or can we do something about them? In this presentation, we will try to answer these questions by looking into cyber trends and the numbers supporting them.

      <symposium-speaker name="Jouke Waleson (Mendix)" title="Building a product with just enough security" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/jouke_waleson.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        "Security is our number one priority". Many companies say something like this but it's mostly marketing rhetoric: no company will (or should) drop all work for a minor security issue. Product Management is about determining the priorities and the direction for a product, in a rapidly evolving market under heavy constraints. It often feels like juggling while sinking in quicksand, surrounded by predators. At Mendix, this is my job. My product is the Mendix Cloud, where our customers run mission critical apps which often contain highly sensitive data. In this talk I'll show you three things:
        <ul>
          <li>how our security priorities shifted over time as we landed our first enterprise customers;</li>
          <li>how I make decisions and set priorities for security issues;</li>
          <li>how we architected our product to minimize our worries about security.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Jouke Waleson (1988) is Product Manager Cloud at Mendix R &amp; D in Rotterdam. He studied Computer Science and Cognitive Artificial Intelligence at Utrecht University and for a short time English Language and Culture at Leiden University. In 2011 he joined Mendix while the company was still in start-up mode, as one of the first developers for the Mendix Cloud. Some years ago he made the switch to Product Management. Jouke has three small kids, lives in Utrecht and likes life.

      <symposium-speaker name="Karin (AIVD)" title="Will a quantum computer reveal our secrets?" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/karin.png">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        In the presentation, I will give an intuitive explanation of what makes a quantum computer different from a classical computer and what threats it introduces for state-of-the-art cryptography. What can be done with Grover and with Shor? Which algorithms are broken and which are not? Then I give insight in what our predictions are for when there will be a large quantum computer, and describe the most relevant quantum attack scenario's. Finally I will give the quantum-resistant solutions we see, including post-quantum cryptography.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        After studying applied mathematics at the Eindhoven University of Technology, with a final thesis on quantum crypto, I started working at the NBV (in English NLNCSA) which is part of the AIVD. At the NBV, and together with a team of experts, I evaluate information security products for the protection of classified information. Examples are dedicated ultrasecure mobile phones, laptops with encrypted harddisk and secure network communication. Certain state secrets need to stay secret for over 30 years. Since we take into account that there will be a large quantum computer within this timeframe, already now we include the quantum computer as a threat vector in our security model. This means the quantum computer is already part of my daily work.

      <symposium-speaker name="Gjoko Krstic (UL-TS)" title="The risk of botnets through malware infected IoT devices: how to protect from being vulnerable" image="/2017/images-optimized/speakers/gjoko_krstic.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Internet connected cars, toys and even medical tools have already been shown to be vulnerable. And new vulnerabilities are being found every day, as quickly as manufacturers can patch them. In the very near future, we could be living in homes which are constantly collecting knowledge about everything we do – when we sleep, where we are in the house at any time of the day, and how long we leave our homes empty for. Potential dangers include hackers selling this information to the highest bidder on the dark web – and in a nightmare scenario perhaps even offering to unlock your doors or windows remotely at a pre-agreed time. If an attacker is being creepy rather than trying to actually physically get at you or your property, they could access remotely controlled devices such as security cameras or baby monitors, or even just turn lights on and off in the middle of the night. In this digital age, the risk of botnets through malware infected IoT devices is very real. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the importance of keeping those devices safe and secure, and how to protect You from being vulnerable, not to be an invisible part of a large zombie operations…the botnet.
        <br> <br>
