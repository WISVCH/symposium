      <symposium-speaker name="Herbert Bos" title="New generation of security problems" image="../../images-optimized/speakers/speaker-placeholder.png">
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Herbert Bos is professor of Systems and Network Security at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where he heads the VUSec research group. He obtained his Ph.D. from Cambridge University Computer Laboratory (UK). Coming from a systems background, he drifted into security a few years ago and never left. CSrankings.org listed the group as the #1 research group in Computer Security in the world over 2016. He is very proud of his (former) students, three of whom have won the Roger Needham Ph.D. Award for best Ph.D. thesis in systems in Europe.

      <symposium-speaker name="Wieb Bosma" title="Cryptography and prime numbers" image="../../images-optimized/speakers/Wieb Bosma.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Many important protocols for cryptography that are based on mathematics are dependent on properties of prime numbers. In particular, they often rely for their security on the difficulty of certain problems, such as determining discrete logarithms in certain groups, or finding the order of (elements in) those groups, defined in terms of `large' prime numbers; in many cases prime factorisation is a bottleneck in the computations. The aim of this talk is to provide a feeling for what `large prime numbers' are: how hard is it to find them and to distinguish them from composite numbers? What properties of primes are essential and which algorithms are used? At what size of parameters is it still possible to deal with the cryptographic challenges using a publicly available, but highly developed, computer algebra system?
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Wieb Bosma (Texel, 1958) studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam, where he also wrote his Ph.D. thesis (on an algorithm for primality proving). After that, he worked for seven years at the University of Sydney, Australia, on the development of the language for the computer algebra system Magma, while also responsible for the number theoretic and combinatorial algorithms implemented in that system. Currently, he is associate professor in Computer Algebra at the Radboud University Nijmegen, where he teaches Mathematics and conducts research on algorithms and automata, on the border of Mathematics and Computer Science. He is also associated with the Cryptology group of Ronald Cramer at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam.

      <symposium-speaker name="Bart Seghers (Thales)" title="Cybercrime and trends" image="../../images-optimized/speakers/Bart Seghers.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Cyber threats and cyber-attacks pop up in the media every day. Furthermore, they seem to be getting more and more sophisticated over time. Who are performing these attacks nowadays? And are we lost already because of their complexity or can we do something about them? In this presentation, we will try to answer these questions by looking into cyber trends and the numbers supporting them.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Bart is Consulting Manager at Thales Cyber security and has been active for over 10 years in the Cyber security area. During this time he advised numerous national and international customers regarding Cyber security. His focus has been on threat and vulnerability management, security monitoring, risk mitigation and reviewing and auditing. Prior to his time at Thales, he worked as Security consultant at PwC (2007-2012).

      <symposium-speaker name="Gjoko Krstic (UL)" title="The risk of botnets through malware infected IoT devices: how to protect from being vulnerable" image="../../images-optimized/speakers/Gjoko Krstic.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        Internet connected cars, toys and even medical tools have already been shown to be vulnerable. And new vulnerabilities are being found every day, as quickly as manufacturers can patch them. In the very near future, we could be living in homes which are constantly collecting knowledge about everything we do – when we sleep, where we are in the house at any time of the day, and how long we leave our homes empty for. Potential dangers include hackers selling this information to the highest bidder on the dark web – and in a nightmare scenario perhaps even offering to unlock your doors or windows remotely at a pre-agreed time. If an attacker is being creepy rather than trying to actually physically get at you or your property, they could access remotely controlled devices such as security cameras or baby monitors, or even just turn lights on and off in the middle of the night. In this digital age, the risk of botnets through malware infected IoT devices is very real. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the importance of keeping those devices safe and secure, and how to protect You from being vulnerable, not to be an invisible part of a large zombie operations…the botnet.

        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Principal Security Advisor at UL Transaction Security (Netherlands) and founder and lead information security engineer of Zero Science Lab, a Macedonian information security research and development laboratory. Gjoko has been active in the “security industry” for almost 13 years. He has experience in many fields in cyber security including: penetration testing, malware analysis, vulnerability and exploit research, incident handling, fuzzing, binary exploitation, embedded operating systems, ICS/SCADA hacking, ethical hacking instructor, and so on. During the last 5 years, he has been involved in international projects with governments and large organizations around the globe, dealing with security hardening and evaluation of smart systems and devices, applications and networks. At UL-TS, he likes to find zero-days in various IoT devices and embedded systems, and occasionally engage in some CTF challenges and bug bounty programs.

      <symposium-speaker name="Cees van Wijk" title="" image="../../images-optimized/speakers/Cees van Wijk.jpg">
        <b>Abstract</b><br>
        When the hype around Bitcoin subsided and people started to take a closer look, many quickly realized the tremendous potential of the underlying Blockchain technology. As ING is dedicated to staying a step ahead and always looking for solutions to better serve our customers, naturally we are actively working on Blockchain technology as well. One area where we can definitely see great value of Blockchain technology is through the use of smart contracts. Within ING we are working on modelling a variety of financial products into smart contracts. This includes translating legal prose into code, incorporating large numbers of conditions, connecting contracts to external data sources for verification and then executing these contracts between multiple parties in one atomic action. In this talk Cees van Wijk will explain what Blockchain is, why it's disruptive and how it works.
        <br> <br>
        <b>Biography</b><br>
        Cees van Wijk is IT specialist in the ING’s global Blockchain-team. He has extensive experience in software development, cryptography and architecture and is a frequent public speaker. Within ING's Blockchain-team Cees investigates various different Blockchain-platforms and realised a variety of financial use cases with Blockchain and smart contracts.
